// Notes

// 1.   ------Provider--------The <Provider /> makes the Redux store available to any 
//      nested components that have been wrapped in the connect() function.
//      Since any React component in a React Redux app can be connected, 
//      most applications will render a <Provider> at the top level, 
//      with the entire appâ€™s component tree inside of it.
// 2.   -----createStore------ Creates a Redux store that holds the complete state tree of 
//      your app.There should only be a single store in your app. 
//      The createStore function can take three arguements, but for our sake we are only going 
//      to use one. That arguement is reducer. A reducing function that returns the next state 
//      tree, given the current state tree and an action to handle.
